# Description

**Anki download ID: `1483821271`**

An Anki add-on that lets you customize the following global shortcuts:

- Decks (default "d")
- Overview (default "s")
- Add (default "a")
- Browse (default "b")
- Stats (default "S")

You can also disable these shortcuts entirely.

Don't be scared, the sections for you to edit are clearly marked at the
